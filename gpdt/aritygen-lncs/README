Doubly-Generic Programming with Dependent Types

Stephanie Weirich and Chris Casinghino

These files were generated by lhs2tex from literate agda sources.  As
a result, the formatting may not be very good - our apologies.

This development has been checked with Agda 2.2.78 and depends a
little on the Agda standard library (version 0.3).  However, we
avoided using universe-polymorphic definitions where possible by
implementing our own in local-lib.  This was just for clarity of
presentation.

Structure:

  Everything depends on local-lib.agda

  Section 2:
    agda.agda
  
  Section 3:
    3.1 and 3.2: nvec-map.lagda
    3.3: towards-genericity.agda
 
  Section 4: 
    4.1: univ.agda
    4.2: aritygen.agda (this is the generic programming framework itself)
    4.3: ngmap.lagda

  Section 5:
    5.1: ngeq.lagda
    5.2: ngsplit.lagda

  Section 6:
    data-view.agda (the framework again, extended to datatypes)
    ngmap-data.agda
